It all started with me coming to realise that games are made by 
programming. i wanted to make a game of my own! i had an elaborate 
idea, but within a year before i could realise my dream, i came across 
a game on the same lines as my own idea.GTA3.by that time i was in 8th grade
and i was already exposed to BASIC in 6th and later c/c++.

C\C++
-----
i realised that making a game like GTA was a bit ambitious but still i wanted to make one.
i started rebuilding existing games. HANGMAN was the first. in command line,with no fancy UI,
but it was a game. then came a game which looked like dave, had colours but still that too was in 
command line 

Java
----
we had java in 9th grade. that year i wrote the popular class room game bull cow.

Back to C\C++
-------------
10th gade we were back to c++ so this year, growing envious of my cousin who solved sudokus coming
in newspaper in less then 2mins,i made a sudoku solver.
But still no impressive game that had a colourfull interface.so started coding using allegro library
nothing productive came out of it.


first year in College with no personal computing device there was nothing eventfull in my programming 
expeditions.Second year was also mundane with nothing much eventful other than some boring matlab and some long ASM
and VHDL coding.third year i was back into games, this time playing them was on the forefront rather than coding it.
Braid.Portal.GTA IV.diablo 2.COD.AOE.  were some of them and yes Counter Strike. How can i forget vinods antiques in CS!.
Sometimes i hear amarnath ranting about a language called python. i wanted to do something and the choice of languge was the 
problem. not Cpp again, its been ages since i lost touch.The problem was between perl and python.Finally i chose PHP lol!
In the battle b/w perl and python i finally decided i want to do some web stuff and so started probbing around in php.

Internship  PERL/PHP/Mysql/VB script for excel macros
-----------------------------------------------------
And so we had to learn PERL n VB Script.
PHP Mysql was for my free time.


Back to college. My interests suddenly fell on GIMP and video editting softwares(freewares/OSS).There were enough 
raw materials:
    1. lot of photoes
    2. lot of events to work on :P
    3. and the desire to make something[ which engineering failed to impart ]
Why OSS(read "Open Source Stuff/free stuff" ) was beacuse i was astonished by the impressive feat they were able to achieve inspite of beeing free.
they put paid ones to shame.[Single liscence of bare matlab cost 1L INR and further tools, each of them(eg image processing toolbox)
cost 75k INR] Python accomplishes all these for free!!
After a stunt in GIMP and KDENLIVE in fourth year i was back in the same frivolous coding mode after 3years.
And thus enter python as a part of my major project.[Deliberately injected into it by my exitment deprived sub-conscious, to be frank]

A loong uneventful vac after college.
Enter job. I got exposed to C# and real object oriented thinking for the first time.
so long i programmed in object oriented languages using procedural thinking.
After the initial 1 week crash course on C# with hard core OOP concepts there was a mull,
during which90 i made a short php-Mysql settleup(an app for android) copycat.
Tired by the hecticness of bare php coding. i got introduced to web frameworks through a google search.
codeignighter.Django.(got introduced to MVC).Finalised on codeignighter for the next project.first HB of my life happens.regular life goes on.
Until Atul tiwari gave me some books to read on.
Br priess series was the most awesome as it made oop stuff sink in my mind hard.
and the series had books on almost all programming languages i was concerned of.
and hence python was back.along came django.Blueprint CSS followed.

Since looking up stuff again was a mundane thing i thought i might document my experiances.



                       ***************
                       *DOCUMENTATION*
                       ***************

>>>>>> Not exactly a documentation it is a collection of xperiances <<<<<<


i used linux(lubuntu) since configuring stuff was a pice of cake just some 
sudo apt-get here and there

python will be alredy there.
mysql-server
python-mysqldb
get django.
go to folder where you want to 
setup git.

Step 1:
django-admin.py startproject <pname>                                    //automatically creates a folder with pname
    in settings.py set:
        DATABASES
        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfResponseMiddleware'
        TEMPLATE_DIRS                                                   //where you store your templates
os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),'templates').replace('\\','/')
        INSTALLED_APPS                                                  // all apps shold be here.
            <projectname>.<appname>,
Next came into nottice when using CSS files. for the django dev server to serve the CSS sylesheets properly,specify:
        STATIC_ROOT             \
        STATIC_URL               \
        STATICFILES_DIRS          > -http://thezebra.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/usage-notes-on-static_root-static_url-media_root-media_url-in-django-v1-3/
        MEDIA_ROOT               /
        MEDIA_URL               /

    Some reccuring imports
    ----------------------

from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt ------------------ \_ for some crap @csrf error
from django.template import RequestContext ---------------------------- /  found out that its required for css to load
import pdb


    Some important commands
    -----------------------

python manage.py runserver
python manage.py startapp <appname>
python manage.py sqlall <appname>
python manage.py validate
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py shell
python manage.py dbshell

http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/python/web/               -> python refeance
Dougalmathew/dynamic form     dynamic class make using type()   -> django referance.


Python pass by referance problem. create new objects of standard types using dict() list()
figured out how to use a CSS framework namely BlueprintCSS


Setiing up google app engine to work with django
dload google appengine and add path to $path eg export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/google_appengine
django comes bundled.
so set up the app.yaml to point to django and set static url and static directory.DETAILS:
deploying in django.   https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/docs/django#deploying
                        has all the app engine commands to run the APP ENGINE devServer and to sync to G apps

    Setting up VIM for Python
    -------------------------

    Nerdtree       http://www.catonmat.net/blog/vim-plugins-nerdtree-vim/
    Pydiction       autocomplete
    Taglist         for showing the class structure
    Colorswitch     <F3> <F4>
    python.vim      for syntax highlighting
    snipMate        for html tag completion. tab mapped to c-j
